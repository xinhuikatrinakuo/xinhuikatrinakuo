[Household Poverty Status Prediction Using LASSO](https://github.com/xinhuikatrinakuo/WorldBankLASSOProject) | _Python, Data Analysis, Machine Learning_
<br>
- Used Python to built a predictive model to identify households likely to be in poverty using survey data (6,500+ samples, 346 features)
- Cleaned and processed large datasets, transforming categorical data and **standardizing features** for modeling
- Applied **LASSO regression** to select key features, enabling the World Bank to target surveys more efficiently and reduce data collection costs
- Achieved **high model accuracy** (Log Loss 0.287) and visualized top predictors to provide actionable insights for poverty reduction strategies

[Evaluating Anti-Steering Provisions in Two-Sided Markets: Lessons from American Express](https://github.com/xinhuikatrinakuo/amex-anti-steering-paper) | _Industrial Organization, Antitrust Economics, Policy Analysis_
<br>
- Examined the Supreme Court‚Äôs ***Ohio v. American Express (2018)*** decision and how it redefined market definition and burden of proof in two-sided platform cases  
- Analyzed **Amex‚Äôs closed-loop business model** and how its **anti-steering provisions** sustained high merchant fees while funding cardholder rewards
- Evaluated the economic trade-offs between platform coordination and competitive openness using **Rochet & Tirole‚Äôs two-sided market theory**
- Compared U.S. and EU approaches (e.g., _Epic v. Apple_, _Google Shopping_) to highlight diverging antitrust treatment of digital platforms
- Integrated economic theory, clegal reasoning, and policy critique to argue that Amex raised the enforcement bar and complicated regulation of multi-sided markets
