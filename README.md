[Household Poverty Status Prediction Using LASSO](https://github.com/xinhuikatrinakuo/WorldBankLASSOProject)

- Built a predictive model to identify households likely to be in poverty using survey data (6,500+ samples, 346 features)
- Cleaned and processed large datasets, transforming categorical data and standardizing features for modeling
- Applied LASSO regression to select key features, enabling the World Bank to target surveys more efficiently and reduce data collection costs
- Achieved high model accuracy (Log Loss 0.287) and visualized top predictors to provide actionable insights for poverty reduction strategies
